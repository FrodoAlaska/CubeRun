# Cube Run 
A 3D endless runner game where everything is made out of cubes. Brought to you by C++.
Try to avoid the cubes incoming your direction by jumping. But be careful not to fall to the depths of hell beneath you. Avoid falling and avoid the cubes as much as possible. But don't worry, you 3 tries in total. So even if you get hit once or fall, you still have two other chances. Get the highest score you can and become the best Cube there is.

# Build 
Cube Run uses CMake as its build system. So use it to build the project and... *run* it. Get it? Run it? Whatever, dude, just copy the commands below. 

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/MohamedAG2002/CubeRun.git 
cd CubeRun
mkdir build && cd build 
cmake .. 
make
```

# Play 
If you want to play the game instead of building it from source, you can head over to the itch page of the game.
