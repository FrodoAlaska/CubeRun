# TODO: 
- Randomize the obsticles' positions
- Collision events and response
- A way for the player to die and resetting the level 
- Coins 
- Get audio samples and attach them
- Score 
- Save the score in binary form  
- Lock camera's movement
- That's it?

# BUGS 
- An optimized 3D renderer (instanced)
- Better and faster fonts -> Maybe use a renderer batch or even use a fontatlas to retrieve each char as a texture instead of using FreeType
- Better build settings with CMake. Exclude any files, flags, or configs that aren't needed in Release builds
