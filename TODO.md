# TODO: 
- UI buttons functionality
- Scenes -> scene overlays, building scenes, loading scenes, changing scenes, etc.
- Make the main rendering part in the SceneManger and not in the Game. Evrything with rendering keep it in SceneManger
- Entities 
- Textures
- Serialization and making the editor better 
- Physics -> minimal. Maybe use a library but try to do it on your own accord
- Particles. Very simple 2D quads that fly everywhere 

# BUGS 
- Fix the buttons. WTF?
- An optimized 3D renderer (instanced)
- Better and faster fonts -> Maybe use a renderer batch or even use a fontatlas to retrieve each char as a texture instead of using FreeType
