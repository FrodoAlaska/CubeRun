# TODO: 
- Get audio samples and attach them -> when the player is, when the player falls, and when the player dies. Also get some ambient noise in the background
- That's it? Release?

# BUGS 
- An optimized 3D renderer (instanced)
- Better build settings with CMake. Exclude any files, flags, or configs that aren't needed in Release builds
