# TODO: 
- UI -> Text and buttons
- Scenes -> scene overlays, building scenes, loading scenes, changing scenes, etc.
- Make the main rendering part in the SceneManger and not in the Game. Evrything with rendering keep it in SceneManger
- Entities 
- Textures
- Serialization and making the editor better 
- Physics -> minimal. Maybe use a library but try to do it on your own accord
- Particles. Very simple 2D quads that fly everywhere 

# BUGS
- And optimized renderer (instanced)
- Better and faster fonts
