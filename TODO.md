# TODO: 
- Serialization?
- Physics -> minimal. Maybe use a library but try to do it on your own accord
- Particles. Very simple 2D quads that fly everywhere 

# BUGS 
- An optimized 3D renderer (instanced)
- Better and faster fonts -> Maybe use a renderer batch or even use a fontatlas to retrieve each char as a texture instead of using FreeType
- Better build settings with CMake. Exclude any files, flags, or configs that aren't needed in Release builds
